## *Set Up Steps*

### Run Site (React + PHP User Interface):
#### Summary
> The React + PHP site that displays the show recommendations from aws in a user friendly\
way was done by using react vite in development mode and using a php proxy server to interact\
with the Media Manager API. The Site is not deployed so it must be run in these following steps
in development mode.

> Actual Description of how the site works is discussed in the *Overview of AWS Services and Code* section below

### IMPORTANT - Must DO: API Key + Password Safety
> In order for the site to run it needs an env file in the api folder `api/.env.php`\
This is git ignored for the repo so that api information is protected. You will need to\
make this file with this structure (you can copy and paste, then fill out with actual keys and passwords):
```php
<?php

return [
    'CLIENT_ID' => 'API Key',
    'CLIENT_SECRET' => 'Secret Key',
    'BASE_URL' => 'https://media.services.pbs.org/api/v1',
    'BASIC_AUTH_KEY' => 'Base64-encoded basic authorization key that is combinatiton of key + secret key'
];
```

#### Run (steps done in terminal)
1. In pbs-wi-team2 folder change directories to **/SiteScript**
2. Make sure run.sh has execution persmissions, if not enter `chmod +x run.sh`
3. run program `./run.sh` and follow link [http://localhost:5173/] generated in terminal

#### What the run.sh Script Does
1. Frontend Portion was made with Vite ReactJS
    - MUST first change directory to /app and run `npm install`
2. Change directory to /api
    - run `php -S localhost:8000 &`
    - this will run a proxy server that we can access the Media Manager API through the API client
3. Change directory back to /app
    - run `npm run dev`

#### MUST DO: Once Done Using The Site
> the php code makes a proxy server that is running on your local machine. You'll want to\
kill the php program, and the cleanest way to do it is listed below
- type in terminal `q + enter` to finish running site in dev mode
- run `ps`
- run `kill #` where # is the PID for localhost:8000

Example: 
- the php proxy server will be labeled as `php -S localhost:8000`
```
PID TTY           TIME CMD
76522 ttys000    0:00.11 -zsh
76563 ttys002    0:00.10 /bin/zsh -il
77807 ttys002    0:00.01 /bin/bash ./run.sh
77811 ttys002    0:00.00 php -S localhost:8000
76913 ttys004    0:00.04 /bin/zsh -i
```
- run `kill 77811` to end proxy server

### Required Resouces
> This is just a list of resources that were needed to run React site and their links. The actual\
descriptions of how to use the AWS services are discussed in the *Overview of AWS Services and Code* \
section listed below.

## *What Works & What Doesnâ€™t*
Works:
- Current combination of S3, Lambda, Personalize, API Gateway, Step Functions, React + PHP UI

Doesn't Work:
- 

## *What We Would Work On Next*
Cost Analysis:
- Per our mentor discussions the next highest priority is finding services or\
approaches that are more cost effective then the current combination of AWS services
